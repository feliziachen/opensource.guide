## Why do I need a security policy? 

Even small projects in open-source can have a big impact because of the way ideas can move through the community. When it comes to software security, vulnerabilities can move through the community just as quickly as great ideas, so it's important that every open-source project think about their security policy. A security policy helps your community by a) letting them know what you will support in terms of security issues, and b) letting them know how to work with you when they discover security issues.  

## Components of a good security policy

### Scope/Supported versions

Tell users about the parts of your project which are within scope of the security policy. For example, if you will not accept security bugs on test collateral, or samples, you should describe those limitations here. If your project has any official releases or versions, you should let users know which ones are being officially supported here. 

### Disclosure policy 

In the disclosure policy section, describe how and where users should disclose security vulnerabilities here. This is the right place for a link to the private inbox you might host, a link to your HackerOne, or a link to your own custom website. 

If you have any security requirements on the communications (eg, no attachments, signed with a PGP key, etc), you should also list them here. 

### Safe harbor 

Safe harbor provisions are important in terms of setting boundaries as to what constitutes ethical hacking, vs unlawful hacking on your project. These sections are important, so if your company or project has lawyers, now's the time to call them. A good security policy should encourage security researchers to report security issues responsibly, and a good safe harbor provision gives those researches confidence that they won't be prosecuted for doing so. The [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://github.blog/2019-02-19-five-years-of-the-github-bug-bounty-program/#legal-safe-harbor) provides more information about how GitHub uses a safe harbor provision to protect hackers provided that they abide by certain limitations.
